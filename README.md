# Proof of concept for using svelte repl for graph paper examples

```bash
npm install
npm run copy-workers
npm run dev

## Based on

https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/tree/master/site

Stripping things down to basics and not running a node server

## Current issues

- CSS looks terrible! Seems like svelte 
- Need to figure out strategy for actually storing /
  displaying examples attractively, without running as a node server (as the svelte examples do)
